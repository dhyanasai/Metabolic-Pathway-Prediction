# Metabolic-Pathway-prediction
Designing reaction predictors for synthesising novel molecules requires the knowledge of the processes and structural mappings between molecules and pathway classes. The problem of predicting classes of metabolic pathways in which a given biochemical compound participates is addressed in this project work. We employ a hybrid graph based deep learning model called Graph Convolutional networks (GCN) to predict the metabolic pathway classes of the molecules. Unlike previously used machine learning approaches for this problem, our model extracts important shape features using RDKit directly from input SMILES representations, which are atom-bond specifications of the chemical structures that make up the molecules. The KEGG database contains 11 pathway maps that describe molecular interaction and reaction networks and are manually curated. The biological activities of molecules are strongly linked to these pathway classifications. Carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, amino acid metabolism, metabolism of other amino acids, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism are among the 11 metabolic pathway classes identified.
